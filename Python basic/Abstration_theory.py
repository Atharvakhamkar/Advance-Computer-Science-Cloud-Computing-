# Abstraction: Hiding the complexity of features and showing only required data to the end-users.
# Parent and child class..in parent class no need to use print/implementation only declaration.
# If we want to achieve abstraction means we have to take help of inheritance.
# Use of abstraction--> For hiding data purpose we use abstraction.

# Step:1
# from abc import ABC,abstractmethod
# abc-->modulename
# ABC-->Class_Name

# Abstract Class: When we don't know about implementation, such type of partial implementation classes are called as Abstract Class.
#                -Abstract class alwayss consits of abstract method.
#                -For Abstraction class We can't create object..also we can't use constructor in abstract class.
# Abstract Method: When we don't know about implementation, still we are declaring the method that type of methods are called as Abstract Method.


# Any method which consists of both declaration and implementation is called as concrete method.
# Any class which consists of both declaration and implementation is called as concrete class.
# concrete class and concrete method both will present in child class.
# abstract class and abstract method both  will be present in parent class.
